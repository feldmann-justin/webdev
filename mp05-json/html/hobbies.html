                <h2>Guitars</h2>
                
                <p>I began my foray into playing guitar in summer of 2010. I'm mainly a "bedroom guitarist",
                    but that's a "level" I'm personally fine with staying at! I play for me and my amusement/goosebumps alone.<br>
                    <br>

                    As far as what styles of music I play go, it's almost exclusively all rock-based, with my
                    favorites being alt. rock acts such as Dinosaur Jr. and Sonic Youth, as well as many bands considered "classic rock"
                    such as ZZ Top, Neil Young & Crazy Horse, and Black Sabbath. 
                </p>

                <h5>J. Mascis Signature Squier Jazzmaster</h5>

                <p>This is my most recent (and most appreciated) purchase, acquired in summer of 2017. It is a signature Squier
                (basically a subset of Fender which makes budget versions of their famous guitars) designed by one of my all-time favorite frontmen,<br>
                        J. Mascis of the seminal alternative rock band Dinosaur Jr.<br> 
                </p>

                <h5>Fender CD140SCE Acoustic/Electric</h5>

                <p>I received this guitar as a high school graduation gift in May of 2013.<br>
                    Plays just about anything well, folk rock, alt. rock, blues, you name it... acoustically, of course!

                <h5>Ibanez IJX40</h5>
                        
                <p>This is the guitar that threw the spark which ignited my passion and interest in playing!
                I got my hands on this guitar in July of 2010. It is by far the one in my (very small) collection
                which has been through the most... basement practice with a crappy high school band, playing for friends
                to try and showcase my budding talents long ago... This guitar will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
